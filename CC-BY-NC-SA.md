This is the interpretation of the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license I use in my project, to clarify aspects of it of how it is applied in my projects since it is (intentionally) ambiguous at times.

The share-alike portion of this license further refers to the code itself, that must be shared (eg. in a similar fashion to how the GPL works). Access cannot be restricted to such, it must be publicly available.

I will often use the term purchase rather than donation to imply an exchange of value, accounting for the value you have received from the program, however it logically works the same as the word donation. I prefer purchase as it reinforces that value exchange idea, and sets an expectation to contribute however you will if you are able to do so and like the program. However, it is in effect exactly the same as (and hence still) a donation, as the "purchase" has no set price (ie. you donate what you want), and grants no additional access / features / rights (and hence is still non-commerical, both users who have 'purchased' or have not will have the exact same access to the program).

I will also often put a "purchased" bool in the config files of such programs, however, this is never read and hence it has no bearing on program functionality; you having 'purchased' (ie. donated or not) is not even capable of being tracked by the program and never will be. Rather, it exists as more of a mental nudge to support the program however you can, without being overbearing.

If you choose to make a code contribution to the program in question, unless you otherwise specify, it will be under the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license, following the interpretation laid bare before you.
